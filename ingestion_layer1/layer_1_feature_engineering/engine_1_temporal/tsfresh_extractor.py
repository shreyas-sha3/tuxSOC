# tsfresh_extractor.py
# Location: layer_1_feature_engineering/engine_1_temporal/tsfresh_extractor.py
#
# PURPOSE:
# Extracts time-based features from the log using the time windows
# built by time_window_builder.py
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS:
# A single event in isolation tells you very little.
# But 47 events from the same IP in a 5 minute window tells you a lot.
# tsfresh is designed exactly for this — extracting meaningful numbers
# from time series data.
#
# WHAT IT PRODUCES:
# - How many events happened in each time window from this source
# - Whether the event frequency is accelerating
# - Whether this is a first-seen source IP or a known one
# - Sequence position of this event in the current window
#
# IMPORTANT DESIGN NOTE:
# tsfresh in its full form needs a dataframe of multiple events.
# Since we process logs one at a time (streaming), we maintain an
# in-memory event store per source IP that accumulates events
# and allows us to compute frequency features per window.
#
# CALLED BY:
# temporal_orchestrator.py
