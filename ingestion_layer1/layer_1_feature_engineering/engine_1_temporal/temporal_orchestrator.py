#
# PURPOSE:
# Coordinates Engine 1 — Temporal.
# Calls time_window_builder first, then tsfresh_extractor.
# Returns the fully temporal-enriched log dict.
#
# WHY THE ORDER MATTERS:
# tsfresh_extractor reads the timestamp field directly but the
# time_windows block built by time_window_builder gives it
# richer context — specifically the parsed datetime and window labels.
# Builder must always run before extractor.
#
# ERROR HANDLING:
# Same pass-through pattern as feature_orchestrator.
# If either sub-file fails, log passes through with error noted.
#
# CALLED BY:
# feature_orchestrator.py → _safe_run(run_temporal, log)
